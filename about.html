								<h2>WHY THIS SITE?</h2>
							</header><p>
								In his introduction to <em>On the Incarnation</em> by St. Athanasius, C.S. Lewis wrote, "I believe that many who find that 'nothing happens' when they sit down, or kneel down, to a book of devotion, would find that the heart sings unbidden while they are working their way through a tough bit of theology with a pipe in their teeth and a pencil in their hand." It is my fear that many in the Church have never heard their heart sing to the joys and challenges of wrestling with the revelations God has given His people. Experience has shown me that Christians are starving to know more about God and the faith they hold so dear. Many Christians are not sure where to begin or even how to begin growing in their faith.

							<p>Pondering the Faith exists as a place to help Christians begin that journey. We have the Library where books, essays, videos, articles, and more will be posted by topic to give you resources for your Christian studies. We have a page devoted to Bible study notes from classes taught by us so that those resources will always be available to you. If you have thoughts around the Christian faith that you want to share with others, then Ponderings are for you. If you would like to post a Pondering, please <a href="contactme.html">contact us</a>. Our hope here at Pondering the Faith is to edify believers and inspire them to grow in their faith to "be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding" (Colossians 1:9, ESV).  </p>
