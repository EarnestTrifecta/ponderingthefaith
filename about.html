								<h2>WHY THIS SITE?</h2>
							</header><p>
								In his introduction to <em>On the Incarnation</em> by St. Athanasius, C.S. Lewis wrote, "I believe that many who find that 'nothing happens' when they sit down, or kneel down, to a book of devotion, would find that the heart sings unbidden while they are working their way through a tough bit of theology with a pipe in their teeth and a pencil in their hand." It is my fear that many in the Church have never heard their heart sing to the joys and challenges of wrestling with the revelations God has given His people. Experience has shown me that Christians are starving for more of God not knowing where to get the "more" they seek while their Bible gathers dust in the back seat of their vehicle so they won't forget it Sunday morning. We have truly forgotten that we are "the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of the truth" (1 Timothy 3:15, ESV). We exist to hold up truth for the world to see and be pointed to our Lord Jesus Christ.

							<p>Pondering God exists as a place to help Christians remember who we are. It is an closed website for Christians to work through theology together. We use this site to post notes for courses and Bible studies. We have a forum to discuss questions we have about our faith. We have a blog that we use to write out our thoughts and critique one another in love and truth. It is a website created to build up fellow believers in Christ so that we will be ready to give a reason for our hope. Because it is a closed website, you will have to join to participate. I hope you will consider joining and pondering God with us. </p>
