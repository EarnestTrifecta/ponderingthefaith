<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>In Deuteronomy 6, we are commanded by God to teach our children about God and his commands. This is not optional for parents. Paul holds fast to this teaching when he says, &ldquo;Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord&rdquo; (Eph. 6:4, ESV). The full weight of this responsibility is specifically given to the father, who is the head of the house, but both parents share in the wonderful task of raising their children up in the Lord.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>This task can seem overwhelming for us and some of us feel inadequate. Our lives are so busy we barely have time to eat dinner at the table together, let alone study the Bible. If we do sit down to study the Word together, how do I get them to sit still and listen? I don&rsquo;t want their memories of Bible study to be memories of me yelling at them non-stop! Can I even teach the Bible to a five-year-old? What about my two-year-old? How do I teach two different kids the Bible with such a big age gap? Are they going to grow up and reject the faith if I don&rsquo;t teach them well enough?</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Calm down and take a breath. Training our children in our faith is not as difficult as it seems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Deuteronomy shows us that the way we disciple children is through consistency. When does Deuteronomy tell us to talk to our children about God and His Word? All the time. When you are in your house, when you are walking (or driving for us in the 21<sup>st</sup> century), when you are going to bed, and when you wake up. It then tells us that the Word is to constantly be in our minds and to fill our homes. We teach our children by speaking so much about God to them that it becomes the norm in your home. In many Christian homes it is not that way. Conversations about God are rare and uncomfortable, sometimes angry and divisive. God must be the midst of all our family activities so much so that it is expected and not dreaded.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>In this essay, I want to give you a place in which to begin transforming your home. We are going to discuss the importance of the father and mother in family discipleship and give some practical ways of obeying God&rsquo;s law in Deuteronomy 6. I want to give one piece of advice if you are a parent who wants your house to be centered on God, but you have no idea how to do that. For now, do not worry so much about &ldquo;how&rdquo; of discipling your children. Begin by working on being consistent in your conversations about God with your spouse and your children, and over time the &ldquo;how&rdquo; will become more evident to you and it will grow naturally as you watch your family grow.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><strong><span style='font-size:19px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Father and Mother</span></strong></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Most churches today have children&rsquo;s ministries and youth ministries, and staff hired to teach our children. While those ministries have done a lot of good in the church, the downfall is that they have replaced discipleship within the home. I don&rsquo;t have to teach my kids because I send them to church and someone else will do it for me. As a result, parents aren&rsquo;t forced to learn scripture and to know doctrine so they can teach their own children. This is not the way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Notice who is charged with training the children in Deuteronomy 6:4-9, Proverbs 22:6, and Ephesians 6:4. It is tasked to the parents, and discipleship happens in the home. While we may send our children to ministries, those ministries should only be supplementary to what they are receiving at home. The discipleship in our homes should be to such a degree that if our churches were to drop all its programs centered around children and youth, it wouldn&rsquo;t impact our children&rsquo;s discipleship at all. Parents, you cannot avoid this responsibility. Your children look at no one else in this world the way they look at you. Is it hard work? Absolutely, but it is worth it.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>While it is the responsibility of both mother and father, the burden of the responsibility falls on the father. This is not to take away from the mother&rsquo;s responsibilities and efforts, but for the home to be a God-centered home, the father must lead. If the mother is doing this alone, the children will never fully engage. The family will come underneath the headship of the father and when a father leads the way he should, the home will change. I do not care what the culture says. Let their hatred of male headship be the doom of their own households. The father must be the one to center his home on God.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Mothers, you are not void of responsibility. You are his helpmate. You must lead your children alongside your husband and support his efforts to shape your home in a godly way. Your children are watching you. If you go against your husband, so will they. Set the example for them of coming under your husband&rsquo;s leadership. This is not a passive role you take. Your children need to engage with these conversations with their mother and see their mother studying the Bible and praying. God has gifted both of you to serve him and the children will learn how to be godly men and women by seeing both of their parents loving God together.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>To single mothers, your situation is different than a home with two parents. If their father is not involved in their lives, then all the responsibility falls on you. I know that is a heavy burden, but God has given you the Spirit to help you and empower you. However, I will encourage you that you are not alone because you do have the church by your side, if you are committed to a local congregation. Do everything you can in your home, but do not be afraid to ask for help. The people in the church love you and your children and want your whole family to grow in Christ.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><strong><span style='font-size:19px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Getting Started</span></strong></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>The hardest part about centering your home on God is getting started. How do you build consistency in discipling your children? Are you ready for this profound answer? You consistently point their minds toward God. Some of the ways we do that is through constant conversations, the music we listen to, family worship, prayer, and even mealtimes. The idea in Deuteronomy 6 is taking advantage of your daily routines and using the moments you have together to point them to God.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>It&rsquo;s not complicated, but it does take discipline. There are going to be times when you would rather talk about something else, listen to something else, or do something else, but you must discipline yourselves first. You are building new habits in your home and that takes time. Old habits will have to be changed, and things will be sacrificed. Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up and feel ashamed when you slip up and lose your consistency. That is going to happen. Pick up where you left off and press forward. One of the big killers of discipleship is putting too much pressure on yourselves and your children. Remember what I said above, calm down and take a breath, but keep working toward being consistent.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>If your household isn&rsquo;t accustomed to this lifestyle, it will be awkward at first and there will be many hurdles to overcome. These difficulties will be different for each home depending on many factors. One of the factors that will be common to all is the age of your children. Young children are not very good at sitting still and listening and their questions and conversations run in a thousand directions. However, the younger you begin discipling your children the better. If your children are two and you start shaping your home around God, they won&rsquo;t know anything else. If you have teenagers and all they know is mom and dad watching television while they play video games in their rooms, those children will have a lot more resistance to this home transformation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>The challenges you will face will be fierce, but you have the Spirit of God within you. You will have to grow in your patience and gentleness. You cannot disciple children without those two specific fruits of the Spirit. Those kids are your kids, they act just like you and they will test you. Alongside patience and gentleness, you will also need to be firm with your children. You must be grounded in your determination to transform your home. I will warn you, the line between being firm and losing your temper is a fine one. When my family first started doing family worship, my young children were jumping around, screaming, and not minding. I lost my temper and started yelling at them. That&rsquo;s not a good way to do family worship. I have had to learn to firmly tell them to listen while not blowing up when they don&rsquo;t. If you fail in one of these areas, admit it, confess it, and move forward. As the norms in your house change, your children will adapt, but it takes time. These changes are as difficult for them as they are for you. As my family has been more consistent with our family worship time, the kids have gotten better and better about their reverence and participation, and they even get excited about doing family worship.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><strong><span style='font-size:19px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>The &ldquo;Hows&rdquo;</span></strong></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>After I had my first son, I started asking myself how I disciple him in the faith. I found that I didn&rsquo;t know the answer. I felt an immense burden to teach them but was extremely frustrated because I didn&rsquo;t know the best way to do that. After a time, I learned that there isn&rsquo;t a best way. All my children are very different and what works for one doesn&rsquo;t work for the others. Their discipleship is not dependent on a Bible study that we do at night, but on every second we spend together. That took an immense pressure off my life and let me see that I am constantly discipling my kids. I want to share some of the practical ways in which my wife and I disciple our kids. I hope that these practices help you to see that discipleship is not about having all the answers and doing everything perfectly, but about using the time spent with your children well.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><strong><em><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Start Small</span></em></strong></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>When I first started discipling my children, I was looking for the best books and program materials I could find to train my oldest son in doctrine. I learned very quickly that is not how this works at all. Think about how long it has taken you to learn the things you have learned and all the things you still don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s not going to be any different for your children than it was for you. You do not have to teach your child everything you know right now. Let them learn over time just as you have.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>To do that, start with small things. When my son, Dexter, was two, he was able to put together broken sentences. We made a prayer that we would say with him every night, &ldquo;God is good. Jesus is King. We love you Jesus. We thank you Jesus.&rdquo; That is all we would pray. I would have him say it with me. It was simple, but it taught him about the goodness of God and our devotion to Jesus while teaching him to pray consistently. Did he understand those things at two? No, but it was a foundation that we were building. Now that he is older, he can pray a prayer of his own, but I now pray this prayer with my two-year-old daughter. If you have older children or teenagers, start with the basics. Do not assume what they know and understand because you must have a foundation before you can build a house.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><strong><em><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Creeds, Confessions, and Catechisms</span></em></strong></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;If you are not sure what basics to cover with your children, the history of the Church is here to help. Over the last two thousand years, Christians have put together many different documents for the purposes of defining our beliefs and teaching our children. There are three types of documents are creeds, confessions, and catechisms. Creeds are shorter statements of beliefs which summarize the Christian faith. One example of a creed is the Apostles&rsquo; Creed. As a family, we say the Apostles&rsquo; Creed together during our family worship. Confessions are detailed articulations of beliefs that churches and organizations confess. The Southern Baptist Faith and Message is the current confession of the Southern Baptist Convention. A catechism is theological questions for the purpose of teaching people the faith. A historical Baptist catechism is known as Keach&rsquo;s Catechism of 1677, but the catechism I use with my children is the New City Catechism. <span style="background:aqua;">You can find a list of these documents here.</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;These documents are good for people of all ages, though you may have to simplify some material for younger children. You can use this material to ask your children questions and talk about the faith with them anytime. For younger children, it is more about repetition and memorization than anything. As they get older, you can start having discussions about the theology behind these types of documents. Here is an example of how this goes with my son:</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Me: &ldquo;Dexter, how many persons are there in God?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Me: &ldquo;Do you know what we call those persons?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Dexter: &ldquo;God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</span></p>

It has led to him asking questions about it many times and coming to interesting theological conclusions like saying if Jesus died on the cross for our sins, then God died for us. You can have these kinds of conversations any time in the day and creeds, confessions, and catechisms can be a helpful tool in guiding you through questions and answers.</span></p>

People sometimes have trouble memorizing scripture, but most people can memorize songs. Think about how many songs you can sing word for word over the span of your life. Even if a song you haven&rsquo;t heard in twenty years were to come on the radio, you would know every word without a second thought. What are we filling our children&rsquo;s minds with from our stereos that they will look back on and remember?&nbsp;</span></p>

One example that my kids love is an album called <em>The Ology</em> by Sovereign Grace Music. The song &ldquo;God of Wow!&rdquo; is one of their favorites (and I must say I really enjoy it, too). The other songs on that album talk about sin, being made in the image of God, and so much more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>I do not mean that all we can listen to is songs of theology with our children, but time spent in the car while listening to music and singing with our children can make great memories for the family and is valuable time for teaching them about our God. Dexter may shout to listen to a song from a Sonic the Hedgehog album or Power Rangers and Dottie might want a Danny Go Song. I will play them but then say, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s listen to &lsquo;God of Wow!&rsquo; next.&rdquo; Incorporating music that teaches them about God is so helpful in building a godly foundation in their lives.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><strong><em><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Life Experience</span></em></strong></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Discipleship isn&rsquo;t all about conversations. Life is the one of the best teachers of God&rsquo;s truths. There are two aspects that are very important for letting life experience teach our children.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>First, our example as their parents. We can talk all day long about God, but if we don&rsquo;t &ldquo;walk the walk&rdquo;, it is nothing but talk. Our children need to see us setting a godly example for them. Setting a godly example for our children doesn&rsquo;t mean being perfect. We strive for perfection, but we will not achieve it. However, when we fail, we let them see that, too. We let them see what is like to both glorify God with godly living and to trust him for forgiveness in our iniquities. They need to see the whole of the Christian life from us.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Secondly, we need to let them have experiences that will shape them. This can be terrifying for us as parents because we can&rsquo;t control what happens. They need to experience life while we are there to help guide them so that they have a better idea of what to do when we aren&rsquo;t there. My uncle died when Dexter was only three. It made me nervous because I didn&rsquo;t want to scare Dexter, but I carried him up to the casket and made him look at my uncle&rsquo;s body. Even though he was three, he needs to see what death is like and to realize that death is reality for all of us. This did lead to questions and even him asking his mom and I, &ldquo;Am I going to die?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>While we want to protect our children and must use godly wisdom to know what and when we can expose our children to life experiences, we should also not shy away from doing so when appropriate. Taking our children to the hospital to visit the sick, visiting widows and the homebound, and letting them witness the complications of church business and ministry are only a few examples of so many life experiences that will shape your children&apos;s lives for God and create opportunities in the home for talking about God. Be courageous and trust God with your children.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><strong><em><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Corporate Worship</span></em></strong></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>We should be committed to the gathered body of Christ. If we are not, we do not teach our kids about the importance of the Church. This is challenging in a day when coaches think that missing that one day a week of sports is going to keep your kid from making it professional. There are so many things that are seeking to overcome the Lord&rsquo;s Day and sit upon His throne. People get very upset over this opinion, but the corporate worship of God must come first. Our God calls His people to gather and worship Him, who are we to resist that for anything?</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Another challenge with corporate worship is that our children go to nursery or to children&rsquo;s church each week instead of being in the sanctuary with us. Do not get me wrong, I am grateful for these children&rsquo;s programs and for all who work in them. I do believe they are important for our church worship. However, we do need to try to incorporate our children into that worship more often and let them experience Christ&rsquo;s Body as we praise God, proclaim the Word, pray, read scripture, take of the Eucharist, and baptize new believers.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><strong><em><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Family Worship</span></em></strong></p>

Family worship in no way replaces the corporate worship on the Lord&rsquo;s Day nor are we able to have family worship every single day. However, I have tried to incorporate this as much as possible. Though the kids were resistant at first, we have grown to enjoy this time together and the kids get really excited about it (most of the time).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>Since my children are young, I try not to let family worship be very long, but I have added more to it the longer we have practiced worship. The order of our worship looks like this:</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>A song of worship that the kids pick&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>We do a Bible story</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>A short Bible verse and talk about it.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>We cover our catechism question of the week.</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>If you are starting a family worship with young children, keep it very short and work more into it over time. As my kids grow, our worship will transform a lot. Eventually, I will add a time of confession, and we will do a Bible study in the place of a Bible story. There can be some awkwardness in family worship, especially in the beginning. To avoid an awkwardness in singing, I usually play music from my phone or the speaker. Over time, you will start to enjoy this time of worship together and it is wonderful to watch your kids celebrate God with you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><strong><em><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>The Scriptures</span></em></strong></p>

The main point of Deuteronomy 6:4-9 is teaching your children the Word of God. Before you can teach your children the scriptures, you must be saturated in the Word as a parent. Your kids should see you reading the Bible as a daily routine and example for them. However, you are not reading as an example, you are reading because you need God&rsquo;s Word.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos Display",sans-serif;'>You must also read the scriptures to your family and teach them the doctrines of the faith. This is not an option that you can skip. These are the Words of life. How could any parent dare send their child out into the world without giving them the very sustenance that will carry them through the tumults of this world? All the practical tools I have laid out in this essay are meant to help you ultimately to teach your kids the Word.</span></p>

They need an example of prayer set before them. Jesus had to teach his disciples to pray, and we must also teach our children to pray. Prayer is a discipline that doesn&rsquo;t come naturally but must be learned.&nbsp;</span></p>

On one such occasion, my mom was reading, and my brother and I were being disrespectful and rude. I remember my mom getting really upset with us and rightfully so. That was the last time I ever remember us reading the Bible together as a family. My parents are faithful Christians and have taught me about the faith in many other ways, but I wonder how different my life would be had I been intentionally and consistently discipled at home. I know that it is a daunting task, but we are responsible for those little ones that we created. Parents, be faithful to the task.&nbsp;</span></p>
