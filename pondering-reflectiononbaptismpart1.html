								<h2>A Baptist Reflection on Baptism, <br> Part 1 - Introduction</h2>
								<h4>Irby Wallace</h4>
								<p>April 6,2025</p>
							</header>

<p>As a lifelong Southern Baptist, when I study the scriptures that speak about baptism, I come away with a lot of questions. The typical Southern Baptist&rsquo;s theology of baptism can be summed up as the following statements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Baptism is only for those who have trusted in Christ Jesus through faith.</li>
<li>Baptism is only valid when the candidate has been immersed in the water.</li>
<li>Baptism is the prerequisite to church membership and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.</li>
<li>Baptism is an outward sign of an inward reality which God is working in the believer.</li>
<li>Baptism is a public confession of the salvation God has worked upon us.</li>
<li>Baptism is an act of obedience to Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>Baptism is a symbol that signifies our being united with Christ&rsquo;s death, burial, and resurrection.</li>
</ol>
<p>I agree with all seven of these doctrines, which is one of the reasons I remain a Southern Baptist. However, scripture seems to teach a deeper understanding about baptism than what we Southern Baptists believe today. Our explanations of baptism are not incorrect, but they are incomplete.</p>
<p>When Southern Baptists talk about the scriptural verses regarding baptism, we tend to outright deny what seems to be a plain reading of text. When scripture speaks to water baptism, many times Baptists will spiritualize that passage by saying the author was speaking about the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Other times we will add the word &ldquo;sign&rdquo; or &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; to a passage that never mentions any signs or symbols. When I these statements in the New Testament about baptism and watch my fellow Baptists deny these passages, I am left wondering if we really are a people of the book. I know that my fellow Southern Baptists care so deeply for scripture and want to glorify God in their beliefs, but their answers to the scriptural passages about baptism are unsatisfactory and seem to be shaped by Southern Baptist doctrine rather than allowing our doctrine to be shaped by scripture. I am not saying that to insult my fellow Baptist because I do love them, but every Christian group has areas like this in theology, and I believe baptism is one of our blind spots.</p>
<p>Not only does our views of baptism seem to not fit with scripture, but church history also disagrees with us. I know that is not a very strong argument for Southern Baptists because many of us don&rsquo;t care what church history believes and would argue that they were wrong. However, we can benefit greatly from the believers who came before us. We do not live in a vacuum, and we are not the only generation to have had the Holy Spirit working in us to explain the good things of God.</p>
<p>Why then do we believe what we believe if it seems to contradict both church history and scripture? We reject the Catholic teaching of baptismal regeneration which teaches that original sin is removed from us through the waters of baptism, and it is in baptism that we are justified. The denial of saving justification in baptism and the propitiatory nature of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper were two of the major doctrinal debates in the Reformation. The Reformers denied that we are made righteous through baptism because we are only made righteous by faith alone. Though the Reformers denied this justifying grace in baptism, they still taught baptism as a means of grace through which God is saving us which I would argue Baptists continued to teach for centuries after the Reformation. Throughout Baptist history, we have become so anti-Catholic that our theology has fallen away from the corrections made in the Reformation, though I know some of my fellow Southern Baptists would argue that we have corrected the Reformers. Because Catholic theology has went too far in their dogmas and teachings on baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, we have gone the complete opposite direction. Where they take the work of God in baptism too far, we deny any work of God in the ordinance. Please understand, we can deny the baptismal views of Rome while believing that God is working in the ordinances which He has given us.</p>
<p>John Calvin gives two definitions of the ordinances of God.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> The first is that the ordinances are &ldquo;an external sign, by which the Lord seals on our consciences his promises of good will toward us, in order to sustain the weakness of our faith, and we in our turn testify our piety toward him, both before himself, and before angels as well as men.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> The second is a shorter definition which says that the ordinances are &ldquo;a testimony of the divine favor toward us, confirmed by an external sign, with a corresponding attestation of our faith toward him.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> Both definitions are beautiful explanations of the wonderful gifts that God has given us in both baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. One of my big fears for us as Southern Baptists is that our shallow understanding of baptism is causing so many believers to miss out on a fullness of the wonderful gift that God is giving us in the water.</p>
<p>In this series of essays, I am going work out my theology of baptism in writing as I look at the various New Testament passages speaking to baptism. You may not agree with me, but I hope these studies on baptism will enrich your faith and give you even more reason to glorify God for the good things He has given us. I would love to hear your thoughts on these essays. What I seek is to have correct theology that brings glory to God and greater understanding to His people as they live for His glory. The only way for us to accomplish this is to have charitable conversation as brothers and sisters in Christ.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Calvin uses the word &ldquo;sacrament&rdquo; in his writings, but I am choosing to use &ldquo;ordinances&rdquo; for now because I understand the sensitivity around that word. In a later essay, I will speak to the Baptist sacramental view of baptism.</p>
