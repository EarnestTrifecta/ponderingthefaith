								<h2>Discipling Our Children</h2>
							</header><p>
								In Deuteronomy 6, we are commanded by God to teach our children about God and his commands. This is not optional for parents. Paul holds fast to this teaching when he says, “Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord” (Eph. 6:4, ESV). The full weight of this responsibility is specifically given to the father, who is the head of the house, but both parents share in the wonderful task of raising their children up in the Lord.
						
								</p>

								<p> This task can seem overwhelming for us and some of us feel inadequate. Our lives are so busy we barely have time to eat dinner at the table together, let alone study the Bible. If we do sit down to study the Word together, how do I get them to sit still and listen? I don’t want their memories of Bible study to be memories of me yelling at them non-stop! Can I even teach the Bible to a five-year-old? What about my two-year-old? How do I teach two different kids the Bible with such a big age gap? Are they going to grow up and reject the faith if I don’t teach them well enough?
								</p>
								<p>
									Calm down and take a breath. Training our children in our faith is not as difficult as it seems. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Deuteronomy shows us that the way we disciple children is through consistency. When does Deuteronomy tell us to talk to our children about God and His Word? All the time. When you are in your house, when you are walking (or driving for us in the 21st century), when you are going to bed, and when you wake up. It then tells us that the Word is to constantly be in our minds and to fill our homes. We teach our children by speaking so much about God to them that it becomes the norm in your home. In many Christian homes it is not that way. Conversations about God are rare and uncomfortable, sometimes angry and divisive. God must be the midst of all our family activities so much so that it is expected and not dreaded. 
								</p>
								<p>
									In this essay, I want to give you a place in which to begin transforming your home. We are going to discuss the importance of the father and mother in family discipleship and give some practical ways of obeying God’s law in Deuteronomy 6. I want to give one piece of advice if you are a parent who wants your house to be centered on God, but you have no idea how to do that. For now, do not worry so much about “how” of discipling your children. Begin by working on being consistent in your conversations about God with your spouse and your children, and over time the “how” will become more evident to you and it will grow naturally as you watch your family grow.
								</p>
								<h3>
									Father and Mother
								</h3>
								<p>
									Most churches today have children’s ministries and youth ministries, and staff hired to teach our children. While those ministries have done a lot of good in the church, the downfall is that they have replaced discipleship within the home. I don’t have to teach my kids because I send them to church and someone else will do it for me. As a result, parents aren’t forced to learn scripture and to know doctrine so they can teach their own children. This is not the way. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Notice who is charged with training the children in Deuteronomy 6:4-9, Proverbs 22:6, and Ephesians 6:4. It is tasked to the parents, and discipleship happens in the home. While we may send our children to ministries, those ministries should only be supplementary to what they are receiving at home. The discipleship in our homes should be to such a degree that if our churches were to drop all its programs centered around children and youth, it wouldn’t impact our children’s discipleship at all. Parents, you cannot avoid this responsibility. Your children look at no one else in this world the way they look at you. Is it hard work? Absolutely, but it is worth it.
